=======================

Miscellaneous GDB refactoring scripts.


Currently you'll find here scripts used to rewrite GDB in C++, originally based on Tromey's.

* cxx-rewrite.el

  Rewrites C++ keywords in the gdb source.

* insert-casts.el

  Insert casts for -Wc++-compat.

* tc-rewrite.el

  This rewrites TRY_CATCH into TRY+CATCH+END_CATCH.
